        <h1>Taare jameen par</h1>
        <p>Taare Zameen Par (transl.â€‰Stars on earth), also known as Like Stars on Earth in English, is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language 
            drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan. The film stars Khan himself, along with Darsheel Safary, Tanay Chheda, 
            Sachet Engineer, Vipin Sharma and Tisca Chopra. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan (Safary), 
            an 8-year-old dyslexic child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to 
            a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher Nikumbh suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his reading 
            disorder.</p>
