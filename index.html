        <h2>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya</h2>
        <p>The <b>Anwar-Suhayli</b>, which was created in Mughal emperor Akbar's studio, and a Mewar manuscript of the Hindu epic 
            Ramayana from the 17th century are two notable manuscripts kept at the museum. An archaeological area was created 
            with priceless sculptures and epigrams thanks to the transfer of coins and sculptures from the Poona Museum in Pune
             and the Royal Asiatic Society's Bombay branch. The British Museum's director, <b>Neil MacGregor, gave an illustrated 
             lecture on "World Cultures"</b> in the museum's main foyer before opening the gallery.
